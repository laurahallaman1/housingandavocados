ETL Project 


The sources of data that you will extract from:

Our data sources are: 
-A CSV file of Avocado Prices downloaded via Kaggle. Data comes from the Hass Avocado Board.  
-A CSV file of Home Prices via the Saint Louis Federal Reserve. 


The type of transformation needed for this data:

Our process for this project included: 
-Both datasets were cleaned in Pandas 
-Drop unneeded columns not useful for the table 
-Aggregate data from smaller timeframes into quarterly data and total volume 
-Merge and remove redundant information
-rename columns to allow formatting to correspond with SQL 


The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational):

-create a database in SQL to correspond with the columns 
-load into a SQL Database by executing code within Jupiter notebooks
-this code will send the content from the Pandas dataframe to SQL 
-relational database 


The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database:

Final table will include the following information: 
Quarter, Average Avocado Price, Avocado Sales Volume, and average Home Price across the US 

Our interest in compiling this data was inspired by the following article: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/15/australian-millionaire-millennials-avocado-toast-house, 
in which an Australian billionaire stated the reason Millennials are not buying houses due to their voracious love of avocado toast.
